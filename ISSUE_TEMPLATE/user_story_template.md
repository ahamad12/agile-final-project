**User Story**

As a **product manager**, I need the ability to **add a new product** to the catalog, so that **customers can view and purchase it**.

**Acceptance Criteria**

- [ ] Given I am on the product creation page, when I enter product details (name, price, description), then I should be able to submit the form and create a new product.
- [ ] Given I have submitted a product form, when the product is successfully created, then it should appear in the product catalog.
- [ ] Given a new product has been added, when I view the catalog, then I should see the new product listed.

**Additional Information**
- The product data should be stored in the database and must follow the required schema.
- Link to the product catalog database schema: [Product Schema](link).
- The frontend interface should be updated to display new products immediately.
